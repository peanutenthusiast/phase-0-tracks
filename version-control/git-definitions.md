# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
**It's a way control versions of projects worked on by one or more coders, and useful because each coder may work on edits and changes without jeopardizing the master project.**
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
**It carries the sames files of a repository, and you'd use one because if these files are changed,  they don't affect the master files unless they're merged onto the master.**
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
**Commit saves and documents a change to a repository. A good commit message indicates for human eyes what's been changed, e.g. "Add more code"**
* What is a merge conflict?
**A merge conflict is when changes on a branch cannot be committed to the master because different changes exist on each branch.**
