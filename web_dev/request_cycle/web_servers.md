#What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
*Linux is the individualist operating system, worked on by many volunteers. It's not structured, it's not organized, some grand overarching system does not need to OK one individual's decision to do something on a program. Commands and programs are simple and small--they perform a simple task. Linux also uses software leverage, which means that code already made can be borrowed upon.*

#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
*A user of a VPS can use a copy of an operating system from the comfort of the command line of their own computer. It can be used to run one's own private site for a minimal fee.*

#Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as #the root user on a Linux system?
*It's like avoiding doing work form a master branch in a git repository. As long as one runs a program as a user, whatever is done will not affect the root, which could affect the entire program.*
